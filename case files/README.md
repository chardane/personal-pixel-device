# Instructions

All needed 3D print models are in the **3D print models** folder.

1. Print out the file named `grid-v2` - this will be placed on top of the Neopixel 8x8 LED grid to isolate each pixel and shape the light into squares
2. Choose which case version you'd like to print:
    - `case-with-leather-loop-and-mic` - This is the original case that you see in the photos featured in my Make: magazine article.
    - `case-without-leather-loop-with-mic` - This case is similar to the original, but without the cutout for the leather loop.
    - `case-without-leather-loop-and-mic` - This case is similar to the original, but without the cutout for the leather loop _and_ without mounting features for the mic.
3. Optionally, print out the `knob-interface` file if you are going to use an upcycled bottle cap like I did in the Make: article
    - Otherwise, this model might be helpful in modeling your own knob!

The front panels are laser cut pieces, and those files are in the **front panels** folder

1. If you want the original 2 front panels, you can use the `front-panel-two-pieces.pdf` file 
    - For knob panel, I used this pearl acrylic - search for "Pearl" on [this page](https://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/acrylic_sheets_color/341)
    - For the LED panel, I used this [Black LED acylic](https://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/black_led_sheet/668)
2. You could also choose to simply cut just 1 panel, use the `front-panel-one-piece.pdf` file
    - I recommend using the Black LED acrylic for this as well, but feel free to do your own thing!

# Grid Frame Model Credits

The file called `grid-v2.3mf` is a slightly modified version of the grid frame found in the Adafruit tutorial [Square NeoPixel Display with Black LED Acrylic](https://learn.adafruit.com/sqaure-neopixel-display-with-black-led-acrylic) by the [Ruiz Brothers](https://learn.adafruit.com/u/pixil3d). Thank you, Noe and Pedro!

The rest of the models are designed by yours truly -- feel free to use and remix as desired!
