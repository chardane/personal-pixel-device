# Personal Pixel Device: CircuitPython Code and Files

Got here from my Make: magazine article? You've come to the right place!

See this project in action: [my Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxUVY0VrjZ_/?img_index=1)

This repo contains all the files you need to make your own rendition of a Personal Pixel Device up and running. It contains the following software:

1. **A clock mode** - displays the time
2. **Audio visualizer mode** - click the encoder button once to switch to this mode
3. **Focus timer** - rotate your device 90 degrees so that the USB-C connector is face down. Turn the rotary encoder knob to the right to increase the time, and click it once to start the timer. Click again to cancel.

This code will also cause the alarm to trigger at a specific time and play a sound. [See a preview video of that here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx34Lp_PsEI/?img_index=1)

# Audio Visualizer Code Credits

The visualizer part of this code is slightly modified version of the code shown in this Adafruit Guide: [Mini LED Matrix Audio Visualizer](https://learn.adafruit.com/mini-led-matrix-audio-visualizer/code-the-audio-spectrum-light-show) by Liz Clark, code by Phil Burgess. Thank you both for writing excellent code and guides!
