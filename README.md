# Personal Pixel Device: CircuitPython Code

See this project in action: [my Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxUVY0VrjZ_/?img_index=1)

This repo contains all the files you need to make your own rendition of a Personal Pixel Device up and running. It contains the following software:

1. **A clock mode** - displays the time
2. **Audio visualizer mode** - click the encoder button once to switch to this mode
3. **Focus timer** - rotate your device 90 degrees so that the USB-C connector is face down. Turn the rotary encoder knob to the right to increase the time, and click it once to start the timer. Click again to cancel.

This code will also cause the alarm to trigger at a specific time and play a sound. [See a preview video of that here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx34Lp_PsEI/?img_index=1)
